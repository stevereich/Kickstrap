p.lead A few tips to get the most out of Kickstrap

h2 Prune Bootstrap
p Bootstrap.css is compiled from Bootstrap.less. Bootstrap.less is just an index of all the modular .less files that make up Bootstrap.css.
p This means there is a .less file for navigation, buttons, menus, modals, etc. Most people don't use every single one of these and they may want to remove the parts they don't need to speed up their CSS.

h2 Automatically get latest patch from apps
p By removing the patch version from an app in settings, JSPM will get the latest patch number. This means your apps stay at the minor version you define, but automatically retrieve patch changes.
p Use with caution as some patches may not be stable.
