	## .ks-afterload
	Display only when JSPM has finished loading.
p This is particularly useful when you need to hide the 
	span(ng-non-bindable) {{}}
	|  notation before the page has finished loading.
:markdown
	## .ks-afterload_visibility
	Similar to the above, this achieves the same thing but applies a "visibility:none" to the element instead of removing it from being rendered completely.

	## .ks-beforeload
	Display only before JSPM has finished loading.
	This is particularly useful when you need a placeholder for content that is about to load.

	## .ks-beforeload_visibility
	Similar to the above, this achieves the same thing but applies a "visibility:visible" to the element.

	## k$
	This is a global element used for kickstrap functions. Any JavaScript scoped to this variable is exposed to the global namespace.

	## k$.ready()
	Function to execute code once JSPM has finished loading resources.

p For example,
	pre k$.ready ->
		|   alert('hello world')

	## sly-repeat
	This is a last resort alternative to Angular's ng-repeat with several optimizations. Ng-repeat turns out to be highly problematic on mobile browsers depending on how it's used. 
	sly-repeat comes from a popular [Scalyr.com blog post](http://blog.scalyr.com/2013/10/31/angularjs-1200ms-to-35ms/) on this very issue.
	Use this as you would ng-repeat, but at your own risk. It will not work in every scenario ng-repeat would. Hopefully future versions of Angular will address this.
