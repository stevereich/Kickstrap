    Module:  slyRepeat

    Contains the slyRepeat directive, which is is a modified version of the
    ngRepeat directive that is meant to be more efficient for creating and
    recreating large lists of bound elements.  In particular, it has an
    optimization that will prevent DOM elements from being constantly created
    and destroyed as the contents of the repeated elements change.  It does this
    by not destroying DOM elements when they are no longer needed, but instead,
    just hiding them. This might not work for all use cases, but for it does
    for the ones we do wish to heavily optimize.  For eample, through profiling,
    we found that destroying DOM elements when flipping through log view pages
    represented a large chunk of CPU time.

    Cavaets:  The collection expression must evaluate to an array.  Animators
    will not work.  Track By does not work.  Use at your own peril.
